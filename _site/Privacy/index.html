  <p>Personal data (usually referred to just as “data” below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.</p>

<p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the “GDPR”), “processing” refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>

<p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>

<p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>

<p><strong>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</strong></p>

<p><strong>II. The rights of users and data subjects</strong></p>

<p><strong>III. Information about the data processing</strong></p>

<h2 id="i-information-about-us-as-controllers-of-your-data">I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h2>
<p>The party responsible for this website (the “controller”) for purposes of data protection law is:</p>

<p>Klaus Bierschenk</p>

<p>Hurtenweg 30</p>

<p>82418 Murnau</p>

<p>Germany</p>

<p>Email: klaus@nothingbutcloud.net</p>

<p>The controller’s data protection officer is:</p>

<p>Klaus Bierschenk</p>

<h2 id="ii-the-rights-of-users-and-data-subjects">II. The rights of users and data subjects</h2>
<p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right</p>

<p>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);
to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>

<p>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller’s future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</p>

<h2 id="iii-information-about-the-data-processing">III. Information about the data processing</h2>
<p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.</p>

<p><strong>Contact</strong></p>

<p>If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide will be used for the purpose of processing your request. We must have this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we will not be able to answer it in full or at all.</p>

<p>The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>

<p>Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and there is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an order or contract resulted therefrom.</p>

<p>User posts, comments, and ratings
We offer you the opportunity to post questions, answers, opinions, and ratings on our website, hereinafter referred to jointly as “posts.” If you make use of this opportunity, we will process and publish your post, the date and time you submitted it, and any pseudonym you may have used.</p>

<p>In addition, we will also process your IP address and email address. The IP address is processed because we might have a legitimate interest in taking or supporting further action if your post infringes the rights of third parties and/or is otherwise unlawful.</p>

<p>In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in any legal defense we may have to mount.</p>

<p><strong>Follow-up comments</strong></p>

<p>If you make posts on our website, we also offer you the opportunity to subscribe to any subsequent follow-up comments made by third parties. In order to be able to inform you about these follow-up comments, we will need to process your email address.</p>

<p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your prior consent to this subscription under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent or click on the unsubscribe link contained in each email.</p>

<p>We would like to point out that this might cause user data to be processed outside the European Union, particularly in the United States.

<p>Social media links via graphics
We also integrate the following social media sites into our website. The integration takes place via a linked graphic of the respective site. The use of these graphics stored on our own servers prevents the automatic connection to the servers of these networks for their display. Only by clicking on the corresponding graphic will you be forwarded to the service of the respective social network.</p>

<p>Once you click, that network may record information about you and your visit to our site. It cannot be ruled out that such data will be processed in the United States.</p>

<p>Initially, this data includes such things as your IP address, the date and time of your visit, and the page visited. If you are logged into your user account on that network, however, the network operator might assign the information collected about your visit to our site to your personal account. If you interact by clicking Like, Share, etc., this information can be stored your personal user account and possibly posted on the respective network. To prevent this, you need to log out of your social media account before clicking on the graphic. The various social media networks also offer settings that you can configure accordingly.</p>

<p>Twitter plug-in
Our website uses the plug-in of the Twitter social network. The Twitter service is operated by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (“Twitter”).</p>

<p>The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in improving the quality of our website.</p>

<p>If the plug-in is stored on one of the pages you visit on our website, your browser will download an icon for the plug-in from Twitter’s servers in the USA. For technical reasons, it is necessary for Twitter to process your IP address. In addition, the date and time of your visit to our website will also be recorded.</p>

<p>If you are logged in to Twitter while visiting one of our plugged-in websites, the information collected by the plug-in from your specific visit will be recognized by Twitter. The information collected may then be assigned to your personal account at Twitter. If, for example, you use the Twitter Tweet button, this information will be stored in your Twitter account and may be published on the Twitter platform. To prevent this, you must either log out of Twitter before visiting our site or make the appropriate settings in your Twitter account.</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/privacy</p>

<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>

<p>We use Google Analytics on our website. This is a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).</p>

<p>The Google Analytics service is used to analyze how our website is used. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our site.</p>

<p>Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your visits to our website will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it is transmitted to the US.</p>

<p>The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our website and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used to provide other services related to the use of our website and of the internet in general.</p>

<p>Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data. In addition, Google provides further information with regard to its data protection practices at</p>

<p>https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners,</p>

<p>in addition with further information. This add-on can be installed on the most popular browsers and offers you further control over the data that Google collects when you visit our website. The add-on informs Google Analytics’ JavaScript (ga.js) that no information about the website visit should be transmitted to Google Analytics. However, this does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analytics services we may use as detailed herein.</p>

<p><strong>Google Fonts</strong></p>

<p>Our website uses Google Fonts to display external fonts. This is a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).</p>

<p>To enable the display of certain fonts on our website, a connection to the Google server in the USA is established whenever our website is accessed.</p>

<p>The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the optimization and economic operation of our site.</p>

<p>When you access our site, a connection to Google is established from which Google can identify the site from which your request has been sent and to which IP address the fonts are being transmitted for display.</p>

<p>Google offers detailed information at</p>

<p>https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated</p>

<p>in particular on options for preventing the use of data.</p>

<p><strong>GOOGLE Custom Search Engine (“CSE”)</strong></p>

<p>For full-text search on the website, we use the Google Custom Search Engine (CSE). CSE is a service of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland, hereinafter Google.</p>

<p>CSE makes it possible to do a full-text search for content on our website. Access to this search function is via the Google Custom Search search box.</p>

<p>The legal basis for this processing of data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interest is in the user-friendliness of the website.</p>

<p>The feature is integrated into website without modification as a software module from Google.
If the search is activated by entering a search term, Google uses a plug-in to load the information you are looking for. At the same time, the search terms you enter and your IP address are transmitted to Google in order to perform the search and display the search results.</p>

<p>If you are logged into your existing Google Account at the time of the search, Google may associate the collected information with your user profile.</p>

<p>Google offers further information, in particular your options to prevent this use of your data, at the following links:</p>

<p>https://policies.google.com/privacy
https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated</p>

<p><strong>FontAwesome</strong></p>

<p>In order to be able to display fonts and visual elements of our website, we use FontAwesome’s external fonts.  FontAwesome is a service of</p>

<p>Fonticons Inc., 6 Porter Road, Apartment 3R, Cambridge, MA 02140, USA, hereinafter referred to as “FontAwesome”.</p>

<p>When you access our website, a connection is established to the FontAwesome server in the USA in order to enable and update the display of fonts and visual elements.</p>

<p>The legal basis is Art.  6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the optimisation and economic operation of our website.</p>

<p><strong>YouTube</strong></p>

<p>We use YouTube on our website. This is a video portal operated by YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave, 94066 San Bruno, CA, USA, hereinafter referred to as “YouTube”.</p>

<p>YouTube is a subsidiary of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland, hereinafter referred to as “Google”.</p>

<p>We use YouTube in its advanced privacy mode to show you videos. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in improving the quality of our website. According to YouTube, the advanced privacy mode means that the data specified below will only be transmitted to the YouTube server if you actually start a video.</p>

<p>Without this mode, a connection to the YouTube server in the USA will be established as soon as you access any of our webpages on which a YouTube video is embedded.</p>

<p>This connection is required in order to be able to display the respective video on our website within your browser. YouTube will record and process at a minimum your IP address, the date and time the video was displayed, as well as the website you visited. In addition, a connection to the DoubleClick advertising network of Google is established.</p>

<p>If you are logged in to YouTube when you access our site, YouTube will assign the connection information to your YouTube account. To prevent this, you must either log out of YouTube before visiting our site or make the appropriate settings in your YouTube account.</p>
