## Session from the secIT 2025 by Heise

These past two days at secIT by Heise in Hanover have been truly exciting!

As a technology consultant, I often see in projects that administrators find it challenging to manage Entra ID, especially when their mindset is still heavily focused on local environments after more than two decades with Active Directory (AD). And who could blame them?

This is exactly where my talk, **“Zero Trust und Identity: Warum Hoffnung keine Strategie ist”**, came in. The discussions afterward and the **Ask me Anything** at the Heise Academy clearly showed me how much my message resonated and that I truly spoke to the hearts of many admins.

Once again, secIT was a fantastic event. It’s always a great opportunity to meet amazing people from the community.
I enjoyed presenting and being part of the [secIT by Heise 2025](https://secit-heise.de/)
