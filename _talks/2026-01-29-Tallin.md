**Talk at Cloud Tallinn Tech Talks (CTTT)**

Cloud Tallinn Tech Talks was an amazing stop on my conference journey this year.
It was very cold outside in Tallinn, but the content and discussions inside the venue were the exact opposite. Great energy, a highly engaged audience, and a strong community focus made CTTT a real highlight.

After previously delivering the session at HIP Conference in the US, I had the chance to present it again in Tallinn, this time with a slightly refined storyline, fresh feedback from the field, and some really great new features Microsoft has recently added to Entra ID.

**Session**

“Think You Have an Entra Backup? Think Again”

The talk focuses on a topic that is still widely underestimated:

What does “backup” really mean in Microsoft Entra ID—and what does it not cover?

We explored:
- Common misconceptions around native protection mechanisms
- Why “soft delete” is not a backup strategy
- Where real gaps exist in recovery and operational scenarios
- How automation and version-controlled exports can help reduce risk

**Live demos**

All live demos worked smoothly, which is always a good sign when discussing recovery scenarios 😉
This allowed us to stay fully focused on the concepts, risks, and practical takeaways rather than fighting the demo gods.

**Resources**
- Session slides: [Session slides](/MySlides/2026_01_29_CTTT 2026 Klaus Bierschenk Blue TN.pdf)
- PowerShell scripts:
Scripts for exporting Entra ID configurations and storing them in a local, version-controlled Git repository
[powershell Scripts](https://github.com/KlaBier/Powershell/tree/main/Entra%20-%20Local%20Git%20with%20EntraExporter)


The goal of these scripts is very pragmatic:
to make Entra ID changes visible, traceable, and—most importantly—recoverable beyond marketing promises.
