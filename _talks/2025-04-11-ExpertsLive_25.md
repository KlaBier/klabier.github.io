## Session from ExpertsLive in Leipzig 2025

**How cool was that?**

It’s always a pleasure to come together with great people from the community. Experts Live Germany in Leipzig was a perfect opportunity for that.
A big thank you to the organizers Eric Berg, Manfred Helber, and Carsten Rachfahl for this fantastic event!

I am very happy that my session was selected and that I had the opportunity to share my experiences on stage. Every time, it’s a real joy to contribute to the community, have fun together, and engage in inspiring conversations.

Even though the topic was quite serious — data loss or configuration loss in Entra is certainly no laughing matter. However, there are ways to recover, and more importantly, to proactively protect your environment against issues caused by human error or malicious actors.

This was exactly the focus of my talk, **“ich sichere mein Entra ID, bloss wie?”**

The engaging discussions after my session clearly showed me that I struck a nerve with this important topic.

I enjoyed presenting and being part of the [ExpertsLive 2025 in Leipzig](https://expertslive.de)
