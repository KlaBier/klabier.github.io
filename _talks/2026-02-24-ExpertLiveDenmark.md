This was truly an amazing session: **Identity Masterclass at ELDK26**  and a completely new experience for me. Working alongside such talented people and trying out this masterclass concept, where four MVPs and one Microsoft PM spend seven hours on stage delivering deep-dive Identity content throughout the day, was something special.

Together with Merill Fernando (Microsoft PM), Jan Vidar Elven (MVP), Pim Jacobs (MVP), and Thomas Naunheim (MVP), I had a fantastic day with a strong community and a great exchange of ideas and perspectives.

The preparation took several months. We met regularly to shape and refine the content. Seven hours can feel long and we knew the audience would be highly knowledgeable and demanding.

The many questions during the day, and even later at the conference when people approached us to continue the discussion, confirmed to me that the format truly worked and that we reached the audience.
