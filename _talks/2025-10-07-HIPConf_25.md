## Talk at HIP Conference

The [Hybrid Identity Protection Conference](https://hipconf.com) is always a highlight for me. Great people, inspiring talks, and an atmosphere that fits the topic perfectly make this event truly unique.

This year, I had the pleasure of being part of the speaker lineup with my own session:

**“Think You Have an Entra Backup? Think Again”**

You can watch the recording of the
[session here](https://www.hipconf.com/resources/think-you-have-an-entra-backup-think-again)

Thanks to Murphy (for once!), all my live demos worked flawlessly, even the remote connection to my developer workstation back home (across the Atlantic!) ran without a hiccup. (It is time to move it to a Azure VM, but this is another story)

Please find my session slides here: [Session slides](/MySlides/20251007_HIPCONF25_BierschenkPPTVersion.pdf)


and the PowerShell scripts that handle reading and writing to a **local**, version-controlled Git repository [here](https://github.com/KlaBier/Powershell/tree/main/Entra%20-%20Local%20Git%20with%20EntraExporter)


And finally, some impressions from the venue:
