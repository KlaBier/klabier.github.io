## Talk at HIP Conference
--------------------

I had the pleasure of speaking at [Hybrid Identity Protection Conference](https://hipconf.com) in Frankfurt.

My session, **“PIMp Your Administration: Strengthening Zero Trust with Entra ID”** focused on a topic that sounds simple in theory but becomes very real once you run it in production.

Privileged Identity Management is often introduced as a quick win for Zero Trust.
Enable JIT, require MFA, done.

If only it were that easy.

In reality, PIM is powerful but it is not plug-and-play.
To get real security value, organizations must understand dependencies, operational processes, and the impact on administrators.

What we looked at

During the session, we walked through practical and field-tested scenarios, including:
- PIM for Groups and why it changes delegation models
- the interaction of PIM with other technologies such as Access Packages, Lifecycle Workflows, and of course Conditional Access policies
- several PIM wins from the field
- and how Security Copilot can help identify risks in administrative setups

And yes, we did live demos.
