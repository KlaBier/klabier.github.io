# About

I am Klaus Bierschenk, Microsoft Security MVP, working as a Director Consulting Expert with a strong focus on Microsoft Entra ID and identity security.

I started working with Microsoft Server technologies back in 1998, and it has been an exciting journey to witness the evolution of Microsoft Identity technologies over the years. It’s been fascinating to see how these products have become more stable, feature-rich, and globally relevant.

From the early days of Windows Server Active Directory on Windows 2000 to today’s cloud-first world, identity has become more complex and critical than ever. We now deal with hybrid environments and users accessing resources from all over the globe — a truly challenging landscape from an identity perspective.

I work full-time at CGI as a Director Consulting Expert, supporting customers with topics around the Active Directory family, Microsoft Entra ID, and related Microsoft Cloud technologies.
This blog is a personal project, and I do not share direct content from my professional work here.

The motivation behind this blog is simple: I’ve learned so much from the internet and the identity community — from impressive individuals who openly share their knowledge and experience. I don’t intend to make money with this blog. Instead, it’s my way of giving back by sharing what I’ve learned in projects, development, and my own learning process — without any commercial interest.

In 2025, I was honored to be nominated as a Microsoft Security MVP. I’ve been active in the Active Directory and Entra ID community for many years, and I’m proud that Microsoft recognized my contributions.

I also occasionally publish articles — both online and in print — and produce video courses and screencasts for the heise academy, focusing on Entra ID and other identity-related topics.

I live in beautiful Murnau, in the Garmisch-Partenkirchen area near the Austrian border.

And one last thing: I love sports and I’m also an ultra-distance mountain runner. I feel great when I’m out running or hiking in the mountains — these are the moments when I get my best ideas and inspiration.
